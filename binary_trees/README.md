# Binary Trees

## 何です

binary trees are essentially doubly linked list structures, *except* they have a third link, allowing two children: `left`, and `right`.

the "previous" slot of the node is replaced with `parent`.

## purpose of binary trees

binary trees allow more efficient sorting and therefore locating of particular elements.

- likely, it it's a exploit to get a lograthimic execution time.

perfect binary tree: all nodes have 0 or 2 children

balanced binary tree: all nodes have same number of children + children's children + etc..
